This github account was created as a class lab assignment.

This repository, klhowell84.github,io, was created to turn in class assignments for the remainder of the semester. 

After I downloaded the desktop application for GitHub I was able to click on the original repository name and a blue button on the lower left corner popped up that said 'clone repository'. After clicking a window popped up giving me the option of where on my hard drive to save the clone and I selected my desktop.
